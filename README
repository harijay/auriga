If you want to carry out a simple crystallographic workflow wherein you take a series of processed xtal data in the form of sca files and then 
1) convert them from sca to mtz
2) run phaser using a pre-configured search: i.e hardcode the pdb model to be used and number of copies of the single ensemble to search for
3) run a single round of restrained refinement in  Refmac to produce refined output pdb and weighted maps

Then the script generators in this project will carry out that workflow in a multithreaded manner.


This code is very much work in progress and experimental
